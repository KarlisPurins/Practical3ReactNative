## React Native App
### Location permissions
When launching the app either on an iOS or Android device, the user is asked to grant permissions for the app to use the location of the device as shown in the images below.

  <img src="preview/picture2.png?raw=true" />
</p>

### Location marker
On app launch, a map is rendered with the current location of the user and is displayed as a light blue marker. Once the user clicks on the marker, a more detailed information about the current location is displayed as shown in the images below.

React Native Fetch API is used to handle response.

Information and weather data about the current location is acquired from OpenWeatherAPI.

</p>

The size in which the information dialog is displayed remains the same in different map zooms.
